## Concept information from NDA

See: https://github.com/BANDA-connect/NDA-sprint/issues/7#issuecomment-226208538

Attached are excel tables we use to generate the concepts and rules. We also have created a json representation of this which we are planning to push into elastic search so you could consume it there. We're trying to get the community to extend this. We have rules against 4K elements, which is a lot, but it only touches 2% of our data elements.

For json: The “elementTree” in this document is a dictionary giving the metadata for each concept. The “categoryTree” in this document is a dictionary showing the hierarchy of concepts and the number of individuals
